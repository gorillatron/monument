          p="Korpex started spinning vinyl in the late 90's in the capital city of Techno itself, Berlin. His technique is a reflection of Berlin's firstclass mixing and set-building. Korpex played in Berlin for six years, and today you can hear his musical roots in groovy loop-based Tribaltechno/Hardgroove."
          p="In 2005, Korpex moved to OSLO to share his driving groovetech in Oslo's club scene. In recent years, he's made a name for himself at some of Oslo's biggest events, including Amenta, FOOTFOOD (Sunkissed), PERFECTO (with Nima Gorji), Primal Behaviour, and in 2011 he became residence at The Villa Oslo."
